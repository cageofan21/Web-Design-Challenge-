# Web-Design-Challenge-

I built a visualization dashboard website through the use of Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS. The website consisted of 7 pages in total, which were the Landing Page (1), Four Visualization Pages of Latitude Analysis (vs. Humidity (2), vs. Max Temperature (3), vs. Cloudiness (4), vs. Wind Speed (5), a Comparison Page (6), and a Data Page (7).

A dropdown was also created as a means of navigating through each page. A bootstrap theme was used to customize the website. 

## Landing Page

On this page, it mentions the main purpose of this dashboard and from the source of the data, which was the OpenWeatherMap API. In addition, the four main visualizations are also plotted on this page as well.

## Comparison Page

On this page, it shows the comparison of City Latitude with all of the plots used in the visualizations. 



## Data Page 

This page shows the data we used to build the csv, which came from the OpenWeatherMap API and was saved in a csv.
